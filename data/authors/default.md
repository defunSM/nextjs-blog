Oh.. this is the part where I tell you about myself... Uhmm.. let me get back to you.

...Okay I'm back and I formulated some facts about myself so I can make myself seem more impressive then I really am so here it goes...

I'm an Applied Mathematics major so I'm really into math and coding wait no-.. that doesn't sound very sophisticated anyone using the word 'stuff' clearly don't know what they're are talking about..

Wait... Are you still here reading this?... Well just look at my projects and you'll know what kind of kinky stuf-.. I mean what my interests are.
